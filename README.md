Firefox extension that displays RateMyProf info for professors when you hover over their names in UManitoba's Aurora Registration!

![Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0b219c7-bb1d-4468-b33f-5c305954b661)

If scores aren't displaying when professor name is hovered over:
- Move your mouse away from the professor name and back onto it.
- Click "Catalog Search Results" and then click "View Sections" once again.

Install Steps:
1. Download and extract zip folder
2. In the Firefox search bar type 'about:debugging'
3. Click 'This Firefox", then "Load Temporary Add-on".
4. Select the "manifest.json" file in the folder.

From here you can open up Aurora Registration and browse classes as you please. Keep in mind: steps 2-4 will have to be repeated each time Firefox is restarted.
